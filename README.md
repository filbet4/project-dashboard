# Project Dashboard API

A backend web service built with **FastAPI** that allows users to create collaborative projects, upload documents, and invite other users to work together.

The application was developed as a learning project to demonstrate modern backend development using Python, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, Docker and CI.
